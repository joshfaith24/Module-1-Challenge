# Internet: Tools For Success

This website is made for everyone alike, giving out free information in order to show the necessary tools to succeed with anything through the internet. It is used to help students, teachers, aspiring entrepreneurs, and anyone working online, with tips and tricks. The pictures and text are aligned, with resource links being equally spread apart on the header. The images and text are the same size with the same margin on the sides of each one.

##  User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title



## Review
The website is now all aligned with same sizing in images, margins and text. Header and resources on top are equal in size, with everything being cohesive on the website. The website is now visually appealing and the information in the site is able to be read, so all consumers of the content will not struggle.
